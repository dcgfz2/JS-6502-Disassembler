# JS-6502-Disassembler
I couldn't find any web-based 6502 disassemblers that I liked, so I made my own.

**Note:** The opcodes used are based on the Rockwell implementation so it might not be 100% compatible with every version of the 6502 microprocessor

This runs in **client-side js** (no server so expect a little bit of lag) and might not work with older browsers aswell.
